      Introduction
      <p class="text">
        This class, as you may be able to tell, has been an introductory experience in the world of web design. Web design is a combination of skills, using the creativity of the designer to generate an attractive apperance and interface, while also using a more tehcnical skillset to give the product a functional and innovative user experience. A website cannot be made up of mere visual gimmick alone; nor can it sacrifice visual appeal too greatly in pursuit of utility. As we've gone, we've learned a variety of different skills and tricks to help us create our own websites. My biggest issue with the assignment for the final project, besides being out under quarantine for a number of weeks, was thinking of something I'd like to actually create. I eventually decided to show my various development websites here in a sort of gallery form. This was done, on the one hand, to show the progress and alternative design choices that various aims and goals can produce. On the other, it is coincidentially a very efficient and pragmatic move to create something new using a large amount of scrapped and grifted previous work (despite this, I have still put far more time and effort into this launch page than I did all the other sites combined). That introduced and explained to some degree, I hope not to keep you from exploring the gallery as you see fit, and I will therefore bid you onwards, to the gallery of the websites!

      Gallery Selection
      <p class="text">
        The selection will progress from the first pieces of web design I made through to more recent efforts. I am actually missing a few pages on behalf of my extended abscence from co-op, but I am fortunate in the wide spread of development that the pieces I do have will hopefully be able to demostrate. I have left them mostly as I found them, with a few exceptions here and there, be it for editorializing their content, or else simply cleaning up the sites and adding some efficiency of operation (though only in minimal ways). None of these projects are incredibly serious, but I hope you'll be able to appreciate them for what they are.
