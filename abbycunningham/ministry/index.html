<div class="written">-The Bible was divinely inspired by God, therefore it is true: "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness," ~2 Timothy 3:16</div>
<br>
<div class="written">-Jesus died on the cross to save us from our sins and He rose again to prepare a place for us in heaven: "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." ~Romans 5:8, "After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God." ~Acts 1:3</div>

<br>
<div class="written">-To share the Word by giving gifts: "Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name. And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased." ~Hebrews 13:15-16</div>
